          <span class="text -bold">Lifemap</span> is an interactive tool to explore the tree of life. The concept used in
          <span class="text -bold">Lifemap</span> is similar to the one used in cartography with tools like Google MapsÂ© or Open Street
          Maps: exploring is done by zooming and panning.

          Itineraries between taxa can be computed by clicking on the icon <i class="mdi mdi-map-marker-path"></i>. When filling the two new
          search fields, the route is drawn between the taxa and the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of the two groups/species is
          returned. The user gets also access to a list of all the nodes that are encountered in the way from one group to the other. This
          list is clickable.

          Lifemap was written by Damien M. de Vienne (web page), a CNRS researcher working in the Laboratory of Biometry and Evolutionary
          Biology (LBBE) in Lyon (France) with support from the informatics departement (especially Stephane Delmotte and Bruno Spataro).
